# docker-ls
See [mayflower/docker-ls][1]
This repo is just creating docker containers for the above as all
the others that I've found are bloated

All Dockerfiles are within the their directories

## alpine-min
Minimal build within an alpine linux container
Produces: <version>

The idea of this container is embedded use

## alpine-bash
Similar to above, but with bash and bash completion
Produces: bash-<version>

The idea of this container is more day to day use
