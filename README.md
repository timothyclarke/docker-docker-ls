# docker-ls
See [mayflower/docker-ls][1]
This repo is just creating docker containers for the above as all
the others that I've found are bloated

All Dockerfiles are within the their directories


# Tags
## latest / v#.#.#
Minimal build within an alpine linux container
*latest* is the current head
*v.#.#.#* is a direct build of the same tag of [mayflower/docker-ls][1]

The idea of this container is embedded use

## bash / bash-v#.#.#
Similar to above, but with bash and bash completion

The idea of this container is more day to day use
